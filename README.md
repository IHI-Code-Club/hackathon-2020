# The IHI Code Club (Virtual) Hackathon 2020+1

This repo is created for project management of The IHI Code Club Hackathon 2020, so that it looks more professional and attractive to the eyes of public

## Introduction
The [IHI Code Club](https://ucl-ihi.github.io/CodeClub/introduction.html), a student-led organization from UCL Institute of Health Informatics aiming to promote good coding practice and reproducibility in research.
As an effort to engage more with the general public and contribute to the greater good of humanity, this year we will hold a public virtual hackathon event with projects selected from our community.

## Benefits
- Learn how to collaborate on GitHub
- Learn version control
- Practice good coding practice
- Showcase your results
- Raise awareness of coronavirus
- Make the world a better place

## Prize
There will be prize available for best projects in categories:
- best idea
- best presentation
- most innovative
- people's choice
but we put _collaboration before competition_. Everyone is a winner!

## Time
End of Term 3 (June 2021)

## Registration
_information about registration e.g. EventBrite & Inkpath_

### Eligibility Criteria
open to public, but directed towards health researchers who code

### Deadlines
Choose one of our projects or use our template to create your own by 1 month before  
We will tell you which team and project you will be in on Day 1 during Matchmaking  
##### Registration deadline: May [1 month before 3 days]  
##### Project submission and choice deadline: [2 weeks before].   
Selected projects will have a chance to win the prizes above    

## Project submission guideline
### Categories
- Data story-telling (e.g. data visualization)
- Prediction (e.g. ML model)
- Software engineering (e.g. Shiny app, python package, new programming language)
- Data engineering (e.g. standard data format, ontologies, data mining)

### Themes
- COVID-19
- Post-pandemic world
- Reproducibility

### Dataset
_for data storytelling and prediction_

Submitted project will be evaluated based on:
- Relevance
- Feasibility
- Potential impact
- Public reception

## Matchmaking
Participants will form teams based on their project preference.  
If no project preference, participants will be matched based on category / theme / language preference and expertise.

# The IHI Code Club (Virtual) Hackathon 2020+1

This repo is created for project management of The IHI Code Club Hackathon 2020, so that it looks more professional and attractive to the eyes of public

## Introduction
The [IHI Code Club](https://ucl-ihi.github.io/CodeClub/introduction.html), a student-led organization from UCL Institute of Health Informatics aiming to promote good coding practice and reproducibility in research.
As an effort to engage more with the general public and contribute to the greater good of humanity, this year we will hold a public virtual hackathon event with projects selected from our community.

Link with: HRDUK and OneHealthTeach

## Benefits
- Learn how to collaborate on GitHub
- Learn version control
- Practice good coding practice
- Showcase your results
- Raise awareness of health informatics / issues
- Connect with researchers and members of the public
- Be seen by some of the biggest health technology leaders
- Make the world a better place

## Prize
There will be prizes* available for best projects in these categories:
- best idea
- best presentation
- most innovative
- people's choice 
- best documentation / replicability   
however we put _collaboration before competition_. Everyone is a winner!
*exact prizes to be revealed soon. If you receive a prize, you will need to provide us your contact details.

## Time
End of Term 3 (June 2021)

## Registration
_information about registration e.g. EventBrite & Inkpath_

### Eligibility Criteria
This event is open to the public, but is led by and directed towards health researchers who code. If you are interested in health research, informatics, technology, data, coding etc. then you are welcome to join! 

#### Previous requirements

### Deadlines
Choose one of our projects or use our template to create your own by 1 month before  
We will tell you which team and project you will be in on Day 1 during Matchmaking  
##### Registration deadline: May [1 month before 3 days]  
##### Project submission and choice deadline: [2 weeks before registration].   
Selected projects will have a chance to win the prizes above   
If no one interested in project, advertise   

## Project submission guideline
### Categories
- Data story-telling (e.g. data visualization)
- Software engineering (e.g. Shiny app, python package, new programming language)
- Data engineering (e.g. standard data format, ontologies, data mining)   

### Themes
- Reproducibility
- Data diversity and unfair bias (e.g. bias in health data, making tool to help/visualise bias in datasets, how your cohort changes (representibility) when you change a value)   

see clear project ideas in the template folder  


### Dataset
_for data storytelling and prediction_   
Regulations  
Must be a public dataset   

e.g. if web scraping give scripts?   

Submitted project will be evaluated based on:
- Relevance
- Feasibility
- Potential impact
- Public reception

## Matchmaking
Participants will form teams based on their project preference.  
Teams may have a group size of around 5, groups of 1 or more are allowed.     
If no project preference, participants will be matched based on category / theme / language preference and expertise.   
We will help you find a team if you want.    
Matchmaking will happen on Day 1.

# The IHI Code Club (Virtual) Hackathon 2020+1

This repo is created for project management of The IHI Code Club Hackathon 2020, so that it looks more professional and attractive to the eyes of public

## Introduction
The [IHI Code Club](https://ucl-ihi.github.io/CodeClub/introduction.html), a student-led organization from UCL Institute of Health Informatics aiming to promote good coding practice and reproducibility in research.
As an effort to engage more with the general public and contribute to the greater good of humanity, this year we will hold a public virtual hackathon event with projects selected from our community.

Link with: HRDUK and OneHealthTeach
